In this study, data from the ride-sharing platform ZUBER, which is set to launch in Chicago, were explored. The analysis aimed to identify user behavior patterns, environmental conditions affecting trip duration, and compare them with competitors.

Significant usage patterns were found, including:

Popular destinations: The most frequented destinations by users were identified, as well as the percentage distribution of trips to each.
Impact of weather on trip duration: The average trip duration on Saturdays with good weather was compared to rainy days, revealing a statistically significant difference.
Competitor analysis: ZUBER was compared to other popular taxi companies in Chicago, evaluating its market share and average trips.

## General Conclusion
This study explored data from the ZUBER ride-sharing platform, which operates in Chicago, with the goal of identifying user behavior patterns, environmental conditions affecting trip duration, and comparing them with competitors.

Key findings:

1. Usage Patterns: The most frequented destinations were identified, with Loop being the neighborhood with the highest demand and Riverdale with the least activity. Trip duration on rainy Saturdays is significantly longer (average of 2413.02 seconds) compared to trips on Saturdays with good weather (average of 1979.38 seconds).

2. Competitor Analysis:The top 10 taxi companies cover more than 70% of the market share, with Flash Cab being the most popular.

3. Additional Considerations: Most of the data used for analysis were consistent and did not present missing or duplicate values. However, some inconsistencies in data types were identified in df7, requiring transformation to date_time.

4. Outlier Correction: Outliers were checked for the two datasets used in the hypothesis test, and their values were adjusted to represent the mean values of their respective sets.
